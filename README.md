# Gamer Tournament site: StrideGG
This site was built on Pheonix/Elixir with LiveView, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, and PostgreSQL. It allowed Gamers to create profiles, add socials, explore tournaments, view Gaming news/Videos all specific to their preferences/games and receive notifications in app as well as email notifications for upcoming tournaments they had joined.

This is a small set of the code showing some of the pages I worked on or added, large sections of code were removed to keep them private, especially the tournament pages.
